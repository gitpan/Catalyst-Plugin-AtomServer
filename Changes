    - Basic auth now supports crypted/hashed passwords, by using
      Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::Password internally
      in the case of Basic authentication. Thanks to Gosuke Miyashita for
      the patch.

0.02  2006.01.04
    - Authentication plugin now properly emits WWW-Authenticate header,
      and sends the proper HTTP response code, when authentication header
      is empty or has improper credentials. Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
      for the catch.

0.01  2006.01.04
    - Initial distribution.
